        <h1>How We Begun</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Our story begun way back in 2018,
 when a group of young intellectual minds 
 came together to form a technology company 
 that would act as the complete specialist in
the design and installation of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV),
 Access Control and Integrated Security Systems. 
 Since its formation, Bright Customs has impeccably
offered excellent customer service and ensured 
complete customer satisfaction by providing 
the latest digital security systems while maintaining
 competitive prices.
We pride ourselves in customer satisfaction.

    <h1>Where we are now</h1>
    <p>In addition to providing the customized 
security solutions summarizes above, 
client demands have made it necessary 
to shift our focus to delivering a 
wide-market range of goods and services
 which are modified to satisfy the clientâ€™s
  specific needs. At Bright Customs, we endeavor
   to combine flexibility and personalization of
    custom-made products and services with the
